<p class="center">
<i>A Gallery in <span class="smcap">Merlin's</span> Palace</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">[<i><span class="smcap">Merlin</span> is seated near <span class="smcap">Arielle</span>, who is
sleeping on the steps of a marble staircase.
It is night.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>You sleep, my Arielle, you my inner force,
the neglected power which slumbers in every
soul and which I alone, till now, awaken at will....
You sleep, my docile and familiar little
fairy, and your hair, straying like a blue mist,
invisible to men, mingles with the moon, the
perfumes of the night, the rays of the stars, the
roses that shed their petals, the spreading sky,
to remind us thus that nothing separates us
from any existing thing and that our thought
does not know where the light begins for which
it hopes, nor where the shadow ends which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
escapes.... You are sleeping soundly and,
while you sleep, I lose all my knowledge and
become like my blind brethren, who do not yet
know that on this earth there are as many
hidden gods as there are hearts that throb....
Alas, I am to them the genius to be avoided,
the wicked sorcerer in league with their enemies!...
They have no enemies, but only subjects
who know not where to find their king....
They are persuaded that my secret virtue, which
is obeyed by the plants and the stars, by water,
stone and fire and to which the future at times
reveals some of its features: they are persuaded
that this new and yet so human virtue is hidden
in philtres, in horrible charms, in hellish herbs
and awful signs.... No, it is in myself, even
as it resides in them; it is in you, my frail
Arielle, in you who were once in me.... I
have taken two or three bolder steps in the dark....
I have done a little earlier what they will
do later.... All things will be subject to them
when they have learnt at last to revive your
goodwill, even as I have revived it.... But it
were vain for me to tell them that you are sleeping
here and to point to your dazzling grace:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
they would not see you.... Each one of them
must find you within himself; each one of them
must open as I do the tomb of his life and come
to awake you as I awake you now....</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">[<i>He bends over <span class="smcap">Arielle</span> and kisses her.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Waking.</i>) Master!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>This is the hour, Arielle, when love must
watch.... I shall often trouble your sleep in
these coming days....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>My sleep was so long that I am always relapsing
into it; but I feel stronger and become
happier at each new awakening that your
thought imposes on me....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Whither are you taking my son and when
shall I see him again?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>I was following him with my eyes in my
attentive dream.... He is approaching us....
He thinks that he is lost; and his destiny
leads him where happiness awaits him....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Will he know me?... It is many years
since the prescribed proof exacted that we
should live as strangers to each other; and I
am eager to be able to embrace him as I did
long ago, when he was a child....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>No, fate must be allowed to decide freely;
nor may the proof be falsified by the love of
a father of whose existence he must not
know....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>But now that Joyzelle is here, close to us;
now that he is coming towards her, does the
future become more clear, can you read further
into it?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Gazing upon the sea and the night, in a sort
of trance.</i>) I read in it what I read from the
first moment.... Your son's fate is wholly
inscribed within a circle of love. If he love,
if he be loved with a wondrous love, which
should be that of all men, but which is becoming
so rare that at present it seems to them
a dazzling folly; if he love, if he be loved
with an ingenuous and yet clear-seeing love,
with a love simple and pure and all-powerful
as the mountain stream, with an heroic love,
yet one that shall be gentler than a flower, with
a love which takes all and gives back more
than it takes, which never hesitates, which is
not deceived; a love which nothing disconcerts
and nothing repels, a love which hears and sees
naught save a mysterious happiness invisible
to all beside, which perceives it everywhere, in
every form and every trial, and which, with a
smile, will even commit crime to claim it....
If he obtain that love, which exists somewhere
and is waiting for him in a heart that I
seem to have recognized, his life will be longer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
fairer and happier than that of other men. But,
if he do not find it before the month is past,
for the circle is closing; if Joyzelle's love be not
that which the future holds out to him from
the high skies; if the flame do not burn its
full span, if a regret veil or a doubt obscure
it, then death triumphs and your son is
lost....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Ay, for all men the hour of love is an
important hour!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>For Lancéor, alas, it is the inexorable hour!...
Within these next few days he will reach
the summit of his life. With groping hands,
he touches happiness and the tomb.... He is
dependent entirely on the last steps which he
is taking and on the act of the virgin who is
coming to meet him....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>And if Joyzelle be not she whom fate
selects?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>Indeed, I fear that the proof which we are
about to attempt is the only one which it offers;
but man must never lose courage in face of the
future....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Why attempt the proof if it be uncertain?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>If we do not offer it, fate will offer it; it
is inevitable, but it is left to chance; and that
is why I try to direct its course....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>And if he love Joyzelle and she do not
love him with the love which fate demands?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>Then we shall have to intervene more openly.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>How?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>I will try to learn.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Arielle, I conjure you, as this concerns the
dearest being, much dearer than myself; as I
have only one son and he can become what we
well know that I could never be: is it not
possible to make an unexampled, an almost
desperate effort with regard to the future; to
violate time; to snatch from the years, even
were they to revenge themselves upon us two,
the secret which they conceal so strictly and
which contains much more than our own life
and our own happiness?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>No, strive as I may, I can reach no further....
The future is a world limited by ourselves,
in which we discover only that which concerns
us and sometimes, by chance, that which interests
those whom we love the most.... I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
see very clearly all that unfolds itself round
Lancéor, until his road meets Joyzelle's road.
But around Joyzelle the years are veiled. It
is an effulgent veil, a veil of light, but it hides
the days as profoundly as a veil of darkness....
It interrupts life. Then, beyond the veil, I
again find happiness and death awaiting him, like
two equal, indifferent, inscrutable hosts; and I
cannot tell which is the nearer, the more imperious....
It is not possible for me to know
if Joyzelle is the predestined one.... Everything
promises that it is she, but nothing confirms
it.... Her face is stretched towards the
coming years ... and, call to her as I may,
with all my might, she does not answer, does
not turn her head. Nothing can distract her;
and I have never seen her features, which I
can only imagine.... One sign alone is certain:
it is that of the very sharp and cruel proofs
which she will have to overcome.... By these
proofs alone we shall know her....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>And, therefore, starting from this point which
I can surmount, we must submit to unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
powers, question facts like other men, await
their reply and try to conquer them if they
threaten harm to those whom we love....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>But here they come, in the breaking dawn....
Let us hasten away, they are coming near....
Let us leave to their destiny, which is
beginning its work, the solitude and the silence
which it demands.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">[<i>Exeunt <span class="smcap">Merlin</span> and <span class="smcap">Arielle</span>. A few
moments after, while the daylight
swiftly increases, <span class="smcap">Joyzelle</span> and <span class="smcap">Lancéor</span>
enter from opposite sides and
meet.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Stopping, astonished, before <span class="smcap">Lancéor</span>.</i>) What
are you seeking?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>I do not know where I am.... I was seeking
a shelter.... Who are you?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>My name is Joyzelle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Joyzelle.... I am saying the name.... It
is as caressing as a wing, the breath of a flower,
a whisper of gladness, a ray of light.... It
describes you completely, it sings in the heart,
it lights the lips....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>And you, who are you?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>I no longer myself know who I am.... A
few days ago, my name was Lancéor; I knew
where I was and I knew myself.... To-day, I
seek myself, I grope within myself and all
around me and I wander in the mist, amid
mirages....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>What mist? What mirages?... How long
have you been on this island?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Since yesterday....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Strange, they did not tell me....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>No one saw me.... I was wandering on the
shore, I was in despair....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Oh! Why?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>I was very far from here, I was very far from
him, when a letter told me that my old father
was dying.... I took ship at once. We were
long at sea; then, in the first port at which the
ship put in, I learnt that it was too late, that
my father was no more.... I continued my
voyage, at least to be on the scene of his last
thoughts and carry out his last wishes....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Why are you here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Why? I do not know, nor do I know how....
The sea was very still and the sky was
clear.... We saw only the water slumbering
in the azure.... Suddenly, without warning,
the waves were invaded by thick blue mists....
They rose like a veil, which clung to our
hands, to the rigging, to our faces.... Then
the wind blew, our anchor broke loose and the
blind ship, driven by a current that made her
timbers creak, arrived towards evening in the
unknown harbour of this unexpected island....
Sad and disheartened, I landed on the beach; I
fell asleep in a cave overlooking the sea; and,
when I awoke, the fog had lifted and I saw
the ship disappear like a radiant wing on the
horizon of the waves.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>What had happened?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>I do not know.... I would have tried to
follow her, but I could find no boat in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
harbour.... I must wait, therefore, until another
vessel passes....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>That is curious.... It is like myself....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Like you?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I too came to the island through a thick
fog.... But I was shipwrecked....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>When was that? And how?... Where do
you come from, Joyzelle?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I was coming from another island....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Where were you going?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Where some one was awaiting me....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>One whom they had thought right to choose
for me....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Were you betrothed?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Do you love him?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>But then?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>My mother wished it....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Do you intend to obey her?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Ah, that is well!... I like that!... And
my father, at the moment of his death, wished
that I also should choose her whom he had
chosen for me.... He had his reasons, very
deep and serious reasons, it appears.... And,
as he wished it and as he is no longer alive, I
must obey him....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>We cannot evade the wishes of the dead.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>They can no longer be altered.... We must
have pity, we must respect them....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>You would not obey?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Joyzelle!... This is horrible!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No, the dead are horrible, if they want us to
love those whom we do not love....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Joyzelle!... I am afraid of you....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I said.... What did I say?... Perhaps I
was too quick....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Joyzelle, your eyes are moist at the thought
of the dead and belie your words....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No, it is not for them.... Perhaps I was
harsh.... And yet, they are wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Let us speak no more of the dead.... You
have not told me how your shipwreck....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>We lost our way in a thick fog.... A fog so
thick that it filled our hands like white feathers....
The pilot mistook the course.... He
thought he saw a beacon.... The ship struck
upon a hidden reef.... But no one perished....
The waves bore me away; and then I saw
the blue water glide before my eyes as though
I were sinking in a stifling sky.... I went
down and down.... Then some one caught
hold of me and I lost consciousness....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Who caught hold of you?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>The lord of this island.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>And who is this lord?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>He is an old man who wanders like a restless
shade about this marble palace....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>If I had been there!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>What would you have done?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>I should have saved you!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Was I not saved?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>It is not the same thing!... You would not
have suffered, nothing would have come to you....
I should have carried you on the crest of
the waves.... Ah, I do not know how....
Like a cup full of precious pearls, of which not
one must be touched by a shadow; like a flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of the dawn, from which we fear to shake a
single dewdrop.... When I think of the
dangers which you, so fair, so fragile, ran among
the cruel rocks, in that old man's arms!...
What he did was fine; he did the impossible....
But it was not enough.... How did you
reach the shore at last?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I awoke lying on the sands.... The old man
was there. Then he had me carried to this
palace....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Is he king of this island?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>The island is almost desert, one sees none but
a few servants who move about in silence....
He can have for his subjects only the trees, the
flowers and the happy birds with which the
island seems filled....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>What he did was well done....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>He is good and kind; and he received me as
my father himself could not have received me....
Yet I do not like him....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I believe he loves me....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>What!... He dares!... No, it is not
possible, or else the years no longer have the
weight they should have and reason escapes us
when death draws near....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>And yet I fear it.... He gave me to understand....
He is strange and sad.... They
say he has a son who is very far from here,
who is lost, perhaps.... He is always thinking
of him.... When he thinks that he will see
him again, his face lights up, he.... Here
he is!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>I was looking for you, Joyzelle.... (<i>Turning
to Lancéor, with a threatening glance.</i>) As for
you, I know who you are and I know the
reasons that have brought you to this island,
the trick of this pretended shipwreck and the
name of the enemy who sent you....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Me?... But it was a mere accident that
flung me on this coast....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Let us waste no phrases.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>What has he done?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>He intended, alas, to do the basest thing
that man can do: to betray kindness, deceive
friendship and sell to the enemy the too generous
host who was going to welcome him....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Why? Do you know him?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Since when?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Since I first saw him.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>And when did you see him?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>When he entered this room....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>That is hardly....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>It is enough.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>No, Joyzelle, and soon proofs and facts will
show you that it is not enough and that an
honest look, an innocent smile and ingenuous
words often conceal more dangerous snares than
those of thankless old age or of love that has
but little hope....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean to do?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>I am waiting for the final certainty; and then
I shall do what it is lawful and necessary to do
to remove all fear of an enemy who would stop
at nothing. The pitiless measures which I shall
take concern your safety as much as my own;
for the same plots surround us both and we are
united by fate.... I can tell you no more
to-day; have confidence in me; perhaps you
already know that your happiness is mine....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>You saved my life, I remember that....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>You remember it without any kindliness: but
I hope that one day you will do me justice....
(<i>To <span class="smcap">Lancéor</span>.</i>) As for you, go. The information
which I have received is not open to doubt.
When the facts which I fear have confirmed it,
I shall act. Meanwhile, you are my prisoner.
You will be shown the part of the palace reserved
for you. If you go beyond the limits
laid down, you become your own judge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
pronounce your own sentence. There will be
no appeal. Go, my orders are given....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>I obey, but only until you recognize your
error. We shall meet soon, Joyzelle....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>No, bid her farewell; for it is doubtful if you
will ever see her again.... Nevertheless,
Joyzelle, chance may bring you again in this
man's presence. In that case, fly from him;
your life and his depend most strictly on your
prompt flight. If I learn that you have seen
each other, you are irrevocably lost.... (<i>To
<span class="smcap">Lancéor</span>.</i>) Do you promise to fly from her?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>If her life is at stake, yes.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>And you, Joyzelle?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<h2><a name="ACT_II" id="ACT_II">ACT II</a></h2>


<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>A wild, neglected garden, full of weeds and
brambles. On the right, a very high and
gloomy wall, pierced by a railed gate.</i></p>

<p>[<i><span class="smcap">Joyzelle</span> is discovered in the garden,
alone.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>This is the garden which no one visits. The
sun does not enter here; the poor wild flowers
upon which men wage war because they are
not beautiful here await death; and the birds
are silent. Here are the violet, which has lost
its perfume, the trembling, shrinking buttercup
and the scarlet poppy, which sheds its
petals without ceasing.... Here are the
scabious begging for a little water, the deadly
spurge hiding its green blossoms, the blue
campanula silently shaking its useless bells....
I know you all, you humble and despised
flowers, so good and so ugly!... You could
be beautiful; it needs scarce anything: a ray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of happiness, a minute's grace, a bolder smile
to attract the bee.... But no eye sees you,
no hand sows you, no hand gathers you; and
I have come among you to be also alone....
How gloomy everything looks!... The grass
is neglected and parched, the leaves are sick,
the old trees dying; and spring itself and the
dew of dawn are afraid lest they should grow
sorrowful in this solitude....</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">[<i><span class="smcap">Lancéor</span> appears behind the railed gate.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Joyzelle!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Lancéor!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Joyzelle!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Go away!... Go away!... Take care!...
It is death if he sees you!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>He will not see us; he is very far from here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Where is he?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>I saw him go away. I watched his departure
from the top of that tower in which I am a
prisoner.... He is at the other end of the
island, near the blue forest that shuts in the
horizon....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>But he may return; or some one will tell
him.... Go away, go away, I say!... Your
life is at stake!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>The palace is deserted; I have gone through
the rooms, the gardens and the courts, the
long box hedges, the marble staircases....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Go away, it is only a trap.... He has
a design upon your life; I know it, he said
so.... He suspects that I love you....
He is only seeking an excuse for what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
would like to do.... Go away!... As it
is, you have done too much....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>If you do not go away, then I shall go.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>If you go, Joyzelle, I shall remain at this gate
until night brings him back to the palace....
He will find me on this forbidden threshold....
I have passed the limits assigned to me;
I have therefore disobeyed him and I wish him
to see it and I wish him to know it!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Lancéor, have pity! I entreat you, Lancéor!...
You are risking all our happiness!...
Do not think only of yourself!... I will go
where you please, if you will leave this gate!...
We shall see each other elsewhere, later,
another day.... We must choose the time,
we must take care, we must make our preparations....
See, I am stretching out my arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to you ... what would you have me do?...
What must I promise you?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Open the gate.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No, no, no, I cannot....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Open, open, Joyzelle, if you would have me
live....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Why do you wish me to open?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>I want to see you closer, I want to touch your
hands which I have not yet touched, to look at
you once more as I looked at you on the first
day.... Open, or I am determined to be
undone; I shall not go away....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Will you go away then?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>I promise you, Joyzelle.... As soon as you
open the gate, before a swallow, before a thought
has time to hasten from wherever it may be to
surprise my hand as it touches yours.... I
beseech you, Joyzelle: this is too cruel.... I
am standing at this gate like a blind beggar....
I can see only your shadow moving among
the leaves.... These bars are hateful and
hide your face.... One look alone, Joyzelle,
in which I shall see you wholly; and then
I will go like a robber flying with a great
treasure dragging noisily behind him.... No
one will know and we shall be happy....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Lancéor, this is terrible!... I never tremble,
but I am trembling to-day.... Perhaps it
means your life; and it already means mine....
What is that light which rises so quickly?...
It has come to threaten us, it is going to
betray us!...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>No, no, it is the sun rising behind the wall....
It is the innocent sun, the good May sun,
which has come to delight us.... Open, then,
open quickly: each minute that passes adds its
dangers to the dangers which you fear....
A single movement, Joyzelle; a turn of your
hand; and you really open the gates of life to
me! (<i><span class="smcap">Joyzelle</span> turns the key; the gate opens;
<span class="smcap">Lancéor</span> crosses the threshold.</i>)</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Taking <span class="smcap">Joyzelle</span> in his arms.</i>) Joyzelle!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I am here!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>I hold your hands and your eyes, your hair
and your lips, in the same kiss and at the same
moment, all the gifts of love which I have never
had and all its presence!... My arms are so
surprised that they cannot carry them; and my
whole life cannot contain them.... Do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
turn away your face, do not draw back your
lips!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>It is not to escape you, but to be closer to
you....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Do not turn your head; do not deprive me
of a shadow of your lashes, a gleam of your
eyes: it is not the hours, but the very minutes
that threaten our happiness....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I was seeking your smile....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>And your own meets mine in the first kiss
that passes between our lips to unite our destinies....
It seems to me to-day as though I
had always seen you and always clasped you
and as though I were repeating, in reality, on
the threshold of paradise, what I did on earth
when embracing your shadow....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I used to embrace you at night when I
embraced my dreams....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>I knew no doubt....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I knew no fear....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>And everything is granted me....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>And everything makes me happy!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>How deep your eyes are and how full of
confidence!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>And how clear are yours and full of certainty!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>How well I recognize them!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>And how well I know yours!...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Your hands rest on my shoulders just as
when I lay waiting for them without daring to
wake....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>And your arm is round my neck just as it
was....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>It was thus that your eyelids used to close at
the breath of love....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>And it was thus, too, that the tears came to
your eyes when they opened....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>When happiness is so great....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Unhappiness does not come so long as love
binds it....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Do you love me?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Yes....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Oh, how you said "yes!"... "Yes" from
the depths of your heart, from the depths of
your thought, from the depths of your very
soul!... I knew it, perhaps; but it had to
be said; and our kisses themselves did not
count without it.... Now it is enough, it will
feed my life; all the hatred on earth could not
wipe it away nor thirty years of distress exhaust
it!... I am in the light and the spring overwhelms
me!... I look up to the sky and the
garden awakens!... Do you hear the birds
making the trees sing and repeating your smile
and that wonderful "yes;" and do you see the
rays that caress your hair like diamonds sparkling
among the flames and the thousands of
flowers that bend over us to surprise in our
eyes the mystery of a love which they did not
know?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Opening her eyes.</i>) There was nothing here

<p class="hang">[<i>She looks around her, stupefied; for,
since Lancéor's entrance, without their
noticing it, the gloomy garden has become
gradually transfigured by magic.
The wild plants, the weeds that poisoned
it have grown and each, according to
its kind, has increased its flowers,
blooming to a prodigious size. The
puny bindweed has become a powerful
creeper, whose wonderful blossoms
engarland the trees weighed down with
ripe fruits and peopled with miraculous
birds. The pale pimpernel is
now a tall shrub of a warm and
tender green, with bursting flowers
larger than lilies. The pale scabious
has lengthened its stalks, from which
spring tufts like mauve heliotrope....
Butterflies flit to and fro, the bees
hum, the birds sing, the fruits swing
and fall, the light streams down.
The perspective of the garden has become
infinitely extended; and the

out wide, one within the other, they blind the
leaves, they dazzle the grass; I know none of

weeds, which no one dug up.... I recognize

remind me of their former wretchedness....
Here is the buttercup, laden with golden disks;
the poor pale pimpernel is changed into a bush
of lilies; the tall scabious are dropping their
petals over our heads; and those purple bells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
which shoot up over the wall to tell the world
that they have seen us, are the foxglove, which
was pining in the shade.... It is as though
the sky had shed its flowers.... Do not
look at them; they are here to ruin us....
Ah, I am wrong to seek and I should have
understood!... He muttered confused threats....
Yes, yes, I knew he had spells at his command....
They told me so one day, but I did
not believe them.... Now it is his time; it
is well, it is too late; but perhaps we shall see
that love also knows....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>I shall not smile, for the sight is a sad

beautiful love, a love that believes itself predestined
and unparalleled, thus reduced to
nothing, at the first proof, in the arms of a
phantom....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>Lancéor is not free, for he is no longer

the future.... I have tried to subdue her;

it is time to act. Go and find Joyzelle and

I am struggling against the intoxication
and I do not know where I am going....
(<i>Catches sight of <span class="smcap">Arielle</span>.</i>) But who is that
woman behind the oleanders? (<i>Approaching
the hedge and looking.</i>) She is beautiful!...
She is half unclad and her curved foot, like
a prudent flower, is trying the water, which
smiles and encircles it with pearls.... She
raises her arms to bind her hair; and the
light of the sky glides between her shoulders,
like gleaming water over marble wings.
(<i>Approaching closer.</i>) She is beautiful, she
is beautiful!... I must see her.... She is
turning round and one of her bare breasts,
peeping through her tresses, adds rays to the
rays that strike it.... She is listening, she
hears; and her wide-open eyes are questioning
the roses.... She has seen me, she
hides herself, she is going to fly.... (<i>Passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>

me!... I have seen you.... It is too late!...

to know the name of so pure a vision, which
plunges into darkness all that I have loved!...
I want to know also what too faithful
shadow, what profound retreat concealed the
marvel which I hold in my arms!... What
trees, what caves, what towers, what walls were
able to stifle the brilliancy of that flesh, the
fragrance of that life, the fire of those eyes?...
Where were you hiding, you whom even
a blind man would find without difficulty in
a holiday crowd?... No, do not thrust me
away; this is not the passion, the intoxication
of a moment; it is the lasting dizziness of
love!... I am at your knees; I humbly
embrace them.... I give myself to you
alone.... I am only yours.... I ask for
nothing but a kiss from your lips to forget
the rest and seal the future.... Bow down
your head.... I see it bending towards me,
I see it consenting; and I call for the token
which nothing can efface henceforth.... (<i>He

<p>I do not know what is passing between your
happiness and mine.... Oh, look at me and
touch my hands, that I may know where you
are!... Oh, if you speak like that, then it
was not you whom I saw this morning in
the wonderful garden where I gave away my
soul!... No, there is something that is
mocking our strength.... It is not possible
that all is thus lost because of a single word....
I am seeking, I am all astray.... I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
saw you, then, and saw all truth and all trust, as
one suddenly sees the sea between the trees!...
I was sure, I knew.... Love did not
deceive me.... It deceives me now!...
It cannot be that all this should crumble away
for a yea or a nay.... No, no, I will not
have it!... Come, it is not too late; we
have not yet lost our happiness.... It is all
in our hands, which close upon it.... What
you have just done was mad, perhaps.... I
forget it, I laugh at it, I saw nothing, I tell
you!... It does not exist: you can wipe it
out with a word.... You well know, as I do,
that love has words which nothing can resist
and that the greatest fault, when confessed in
a loyal kiss, becomes a truth more beautiful
than innocence.... Speak that word to me;
give me that kiss; confess the truth, confess
what I saw, what I heard; and all will again
become pure as it was and I shall recover all
that you gave me....</p>

Perhaps, without knowing....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Nothing, it is not that.... But I am not
what you thought and I do not care to be....
I am like other men; I wish you to
know it and make the best of it.... I want
all our promises to be scattered to the wind
of some new dream, like this dead leaf which
I crumple in my hand.... Ah, the love of
women!... Well, so much the worse for
them!... I shall live like other men in a
faithless world, where no one loves, where all
oaths yield to the first test.... Ah, tears!...
They were bound to come, I expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
them!... You are hard, I know, and your
tears are scarce.... I count them drop by
drop!... You did not love me!... Love
which comes thus, at the first call, is not that
on which happiness is based.... In any case,
it is not that which I hoped for.... More
tears!... They flow too late!... You did
not love me, I did not love you.... Another
would have said.... Ah, another would have
known!... But you, no, no; go away!...
Go away, go away, I say!...</p>

<p>Who am I? In a few hours I have aged
thirty years.... The poison is doing its
work and sorrow too.... I see myself with
terror in this mirror which shows me the
wreck of myself.... Yet, it does not lie.
(<i>Going to another mirror.</i>) For here is another
that says the same thing ... unless
they all lie, even as everything seems to lie
and to mock at me in this extraordinary
island. (<i>He feels his face.</i>) Alas, they are
right!... These wrinkles which my hand
follows are not formed by their malevolent
crystal.... They are in my flesh!...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
And these hideous blemishes which will not
come away, I feel them under my fingers....
These bent shoulders refuse to straighten
themselves; my hair is colourless, like pale
ashes after the flame has died away; my
eyes, even my eyes, hardly recognize themselves....
They used to open, to laugh, to welcome
life.... Now they blink and their glances
avoid me like the glances of a knave....
Not a thing remains to me of what I was;
my mother would pass by me and not see
me.... It is finished.... (<i>Drawing the
curtain of a tall window.</i>) Let us hide ourselves;
let complete dusk cover up all this!...
(<i>He lies down in a dark corner of the room.</i>)
I give up, I consent.... I have done
what love can never forgive.... I am losing
my life at last, as I have lost Joyzelle....
She will not see me again, I shall not see
her again....</p>

lying in a corner and rushes towards him with
outstretched arms.</i>) Lancéor!... Ah, these
last three days I have lived like a mad
thing! I looked for you everywhere. I went
to the tower.... The doors were closed,
the windows too. I crouched on the sill
to catch a glimpse of your shadow, I
called, I screamed, no one answered....
But how pale you are, how thin!... I am
talking to you without thinking.... Give
me your two hands....</p>

<p>I have suffered, yes, I have suffered!...
I deserved it but too well, after what I said,
after what I did!... But that is not what
matters or overwhelms me.... I would
willingly die, if you could but see once more,
were it only for the flash of an eye, that
which you once loved.... I cling to myself,
to the little that remains of me....
I should like to hide myself, to bury my
distress; and yet I want you to see me first,
so that you may know at last what you
would have to love, if you still loved me....
Come, come, nearer, nearer.... Not
nearer to me, but nearer to the rays that
shine upon my wretchedness.... Look at
these wrinkles, these dead eyes, these lips....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
No, no, do not approach, lest disgust....
I am less like myself than if I had returned
from a world which life had never
visited.... You do not recoil? You are
not astonished?... You do not see me as
these mirrors see me?...</p>

<p>I see that you are pale and that you seem
tired.... Do not put away my arms....
Bring your face closer.... Why not let me
put my lips to it, as I did when all things
smiled to us in the garden of flowers?... Love
knows many days on which nothing smiles....
What matter, if it be there to smile when we
weep?... I am pushing back your hair which
hid your face and made it look so sad....
See, it is just like that which I pushed back
in our first kiss.... Come, come, do not think
about the lies of the mirrors.... They do not
know what they say; but love knows....
Already life is returning to those eyes which see
me again.... Have no fear, for I have none....
I know what we must do and I shall have
the secret that will cure your pain....</p>

<p>I understand that one can find one's love in
ruins, that one can gather up its remnants and

of our love? Nothing is left of it; for,
before fate struck me as you see, I had crushed
out of existence all that it could not destroy....
I have lied and deceived; and, at the very
moment when the least lie begins again in a
sphere where nothing is wiped out, a fault
which love might have pardoned.... Truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
is dead in our one heart.... I have lost the
confidence in which all my thoughts surrounded
your thoughts, even as a transparent water surrounds
a still clearer water.... I myself no
longer believe in it, I no longer believe in myself;
I have nothing pure left into which you
can bend to find my shadow; and my soul is
even sadder than my body....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Did you kiss that woman?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Did she call you?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>And why did you say that I was mistaken?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>What good would it be to tell you, Joyzelle?
It is too late.... You would not believe me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
for you would have to believe the incredible....
I was walking in a trance, in a sort of
invincible, mocking dream.... My mind, my
reason, my will were all farther from themselves
than is this shattered body from what
it was.... I would have liked to tell you, to
shout to you again and again that I was a lie
that had escaped control and that the shameful
speeches that defiled my lips stifled, in spite
of myself, the tearful confession and the
ardent words of desperate love that were leaping
towards you.... I made efforts fit to
burst my throat, to break my heart; and I
heard my faithless voice betray me and
my arms, my hands, my eyes, my kisses
were powerless to disown it; for, except my
soul, which you did not see, I felt myself
a prey to a hostile force, irresistible, alas, and
incomprehensible!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>But ah, I did see it!... And I knew
at once that it was not you that were lying,
that it was impossible....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>How did you know?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Because I love you....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>But, what am I, Joyzelle, what do you love
in me, in whom I have profaned and others
destroyed all that you once loved?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>You.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>What remains of me?... Not these hands,
which have lost their strength; not these eyes,
which no longer have their brightness; not this
heart, which has betrayed love....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>It is you and still you and none but you yourself!...
What matter who you are, so long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I find you!... Oh, I cannot tell how to explain
that!... When one loves as I love you,
she is blind and deaf, because she looks beyond
and listens elsewhere.... When she loves as
I love you, it is not what he says, it is not what
he does, it is not what he is that she loves in
the man she loves: it is he and only he, who
remains the same, through the passing years
and troubles.... It is he alone, it is you alone,
in whom no change can come but that which
increases love.... He who is all in you, you
who are all in him, you whom I see, whom I
hear, to whom I listen incessantly and whom
I love always....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Joyzelle!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes, embrace me, crush me in your
arms!... We have to struggle, we shall have
to suffer; we are here in a world that seems
full of snares.... We are only two, but we are
all love!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>&mdash;<i>A grove.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">[<i><span class="smcap">Joyzelle</span> lies sleeping on a grassy bank,
before a box hedge, cut into arches, in
which lilies are flowering. It is night.
A fountain ripples gently. The moon
is shining. Enter <span class="smcap">Arielle</span>.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>She sleeps.... The breaths of the garden
are hushed around her to listen to her breath;
and the nightingale alone, deputed by the night
which bathes her in silver, comes to soothe her
slumbers.... How beautiful and peaceful she
is; and how pure she looks, a thousand times
purer than the water that trickles yonder, flowing
from the glaciers, in the snowy whiteness
that sings under the pale leaves!... Her sweet
hair lies spread like a flood of motionless light;
and the moon cannot tell to whom belongs the
gold that mingles with the azure in which its
beams float.... Her bright eyes are closed;
and yet the light that falls from the stars
tremulously raises her loving eyelids to seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
beneath them the last memory of the fair
day that is past.... Her mouth is a moist,
breathing flower; and the lilies have poured
dewdrops on her bare shoulder, to give her her
share of the pearls which night distributes in
silence, in the name of the heavens that open
over the treasure of the worlds.... Ah, Joyzelle,
Joyzelle! I am but a phantom lost in
the night, more lost than you, for all my clear-sightedness,
and nearer the tomb where happiness
expires.... I am not my own mistress;
I obey my master, I can give nothing but an
invisible kiss, which cannot wake you and is
not even mine.... But I love you, I love you,
as a less happy sister loves her whom love has
chosen first.... I love you, I encompass you
with all the powers that are not named in the
prayers of men; and I would that my master
had met you earlier, before fate, which hurries
forward that incomparable hour, had fixed the
tearful future that awaits him and awaits me
with him.... I spread my powerless, troubled
affection over your calm sleep.... Here is the
only kiss that I can give you.... Ah, why
does not he of whom I am but the unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and docile shadow come himself to lay it on
your lips, which call to mine even as all that
is beautiful calls to mystery!...</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">[<i>She kisses <span class="smcap">Joyzelle</span> on the forehead.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle</span>.</p>

<p>(<i>In her sleep.</i>) Lancéor!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>One more.... The last, even as we drink of
the well defended by the angels who keep the
secrets of time and space, the well at whose
brink we shall never rest again....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Sleeping, talking as in a dream.</i>) Is that
you, Lancéor?... How sweet your lips are
at the breath of dawn!... I swoon beneath
the flowers that fall from paradise....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>Faithful in sleep and constant in her dreams!...
The demons of the night will steal nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
from the love that fills the past and future of a
heart!... Ah, my master and father!... It
is she whom your only hope awaited, in vain,
to avert the fate that threatens your old age!...
O master, if you be willing, there is yet
time; and happiness is here: you have but to
gather it!... It sways uncertain between
your son and you; a gesture would be enough
to fix it upon ourselves.... Come hither, she
is yours!... Come, come, come, I am calling
you.... I know that I am right and that
man must not renounce life and ruin himself
to save those whom he loves....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>(<i>In the distance, in a voice of grave reproach.</i>)
Arielle!...</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">[<i>He enters, wrapped in a long cloak.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>I am speaking for you and my voice is your
voice.... I speak in the name of your heart,
which loves deeply and dares not confess it....
You had, at this prescribed moment, to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that sleeping woman, in order to avoid one
who will destroy your old age....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Begone, it is too late....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>No, it is not too late; this is the one moment;
and your destiny depends on the movement
which you make....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Begone, do not tempt me, or I will plunge
you back into your impotent shade.... I
drew you from it to open my eyes, not to
mislead me....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>To listen to the instinct by which alone men
are saved is not to be misled.... Think of
the terrible days which Viviane is preparing:
Viviane, whom you must love if you do not
love this one....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Viviane?... Is it in this life or in some
other world that that name resounds within my
secret heart like a name of madness, sorrow and
shame?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>No, it is in this life, the only one that you
possess.... It is the name of the fairy who, in
Brocéliande, where your fate leads you, awaits
your appearance to shatter your old age....
O master, I see her!... Have a care, she
approaches and will win your heart!... So
soon as this love, so pure, so healthful, has lost
its claims, hers crawls out of the shadow....
Master, I entreat you!... My eyes are counting
her wiles: she entwines you with her arms
which travesty love; she takes away your power,
your reason, your wisdom; she snatches from
you at last the secret of your strength; and,
like an old, drunken man, you fall to the ground....
Then she strips you, mocks at you, rises
to her feet and closes on us the door of the
mortal cavern which will never open again....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>It is inevitable, then?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>You know, as I do, that nothing can deceive
me where you are concerned.... Master, I
beseech you, both for yourself and for me, who
love the light and who must lose it with you!...
This is the irrevocable hour!... Choose,
choose life!... It still offers itself and therefore
it belongs to us and you have a right to
it!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Begone, it is useless.... Besides, this one
would never have loved me....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>It is enough that you love her and that
he whom she loves no longer stands between
you.... That is what I read in the two
futures....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Wiping the sweat of anguish from his
brow.</i>) Begone, for I know.... And so it
was written that, by loving this child, I
could have saved myself.... But she is
not for me; and my hour is past....
This is the hour of those who come and
who have met as time ordained, as life
ordained.... Begone, begone, I say!...
(<i><span class="smcap">Arielle</span>, veiling her features, exit silently.</i>)
I surrender my share; and it is for you, my
son, that I complete the proof.... (<i>He takes
off his cloak and appears taller and younger,
dressed in clothes similar to <span class="smcap">Lancéor's</span> and
presenting a strange resemblance to him.
Approaching <span class="smcap">Joyzelle</span>.</i>) Ah, my innocent
Joyzelle!... You will suffer too, you must
suffer still more, since destiny lies hidden
in your tears; but what matter the sorrows
that lead to love?... I would gladly exchange
all the joys that I have known in
my poor life for the most cruel of those
happy sorrows.... (<i>He leans over <span class="smcap">Joyzelle</span>.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Arielle spoke truly. I have but to make a
movement to put back the hours and the days
and thus escape the horrible end which fate
reserves for me.... Yes, but that movement
destroys him whom I love more than myself,
him whom the years have chosen for the love
for which I had hoped.... Ah, when we thus
hold in our hands our own happiness and that
of another man; when we must crush one so
that the other may survive: it is then that we
feel how deep are the roots that bind us to the
earth on which we suffer; it is then that life
utters a superhuman cry to make itself heard
and to defend its rights!... But it is then
also that we must give ear to the other voice
that speaks, to the voice that has nothing
definite or sure to tell us, that has nothing
to promise and that is only a murmur more
sacred than life's inarticulate cries....
Lancéor and Joyzelle, love each other, love
me, for I have loved you.... I am
feeble and frail and made for happiness like
other men; nor do I surrender my share
without a struggle.... Love each other, my
children; I am listening to the little voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
which has nothing to tell me, but which alone
is right.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">[<i>He kneels before <span class="smcap">Joyzelle</span> and kisses

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Waking with a start.</i>) Lancéor!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Yes, it is I: the darkness has led me to
you; and I come to wake you with a new kiss,
so that you may....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Springing up and looking at him in terror.</i>)
Who are you?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Putting out his arms to embrace her.</i>) You
know who I am, Joyzelle, and love must tell
you....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Drawing back violently.</i>) Ah, do not
touch me, or I shall summon death to come
to put an end to this horrible dream!...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
I know not what phantoms have haunted
this night, but this is the vilest, the basest,
the most cowardly that the darkness has
sent!... I do not believe in it yet!... I
am bruising my eyes in trying to awake
myself!... Ah, do not come near me!...
Back!... Begone!... You fill me with
horror!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Look at me, Joyzelle!... I do not
understand you; and doubtless sleep still
troubles....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Where is he?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Wake, Joyzelle....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Where is he and what have you done
with him?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>He is wherever I am; and, if your eyes
mislead you....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Do you not know that I carry him here,
in these eyes which see you and compare
what he is with what you are?... Have
you not seen what he is in my heart, that
you should copy him thus?... You, beside
him; you, in his clothes and under his aspect:
ah, it is as though death pretended to be
life!... But there might be twenty thousand
of you resembling him and he alone be changed
from what he was yesterday; and I would
sweep away the twenty thousand phantoms,
to go to the only man who is not a dream
among the other dreams!... Oh, do not
try to hide in the shadow.... You retreat
too late; I have discovered you and I know
who you are... I know your spells; and how
I should laugh at them, did I not fear that,
by your witchcraft, when usurping that dear
and unrecognizable shape, you have caused
him to suffer!... What have you done to
him?... Where is he?... I will know....
You shall not go without answering....
(<i>Seizing <span class="smcap">Merlin's</span> hand.</i>) I am alone, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
weak.... But I insist, I insist.... I will
know, I will know!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>I love you too much, Joyzelle, to do him
any harm, so long as you love him.... He
has therefore nothing to fear.... Do you
not fear me either. I am not here to take
advantage of the darkness and surprise your
heart. I had another object.... Listen to
me, Joyzelle; it is no longer the rival or the
unhappy lover that speaks to you; it is a
prudent and anxious father.... Before he
came who conquered you, as never man in
this world conquered woman, I had, I confess,
caught a glimpse of a happiness which it is
idle to pursue in the decline of years....
To-day I retire, sadly, but in good faith....
I know how much you love the poor unconscious
being whom malevolent chance has
placed upon your road.... And do not
mistake me: I am speaking of him now
without hatred or envy, but not without dismay,
when I think of the heart-rending days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
which he is preparing for you.... That is
why I insist on enlightening you as regards
him, at the risk of displeasing you.... I
have no other care than to make you turn
away from an unhappy love in which nothing
but tears and disillusion awaits you.... I
have no hope for myself.... I do not
ask you to love me in his stead.... You
have shown me fully that that is impossible....
I desire only that you will cease to love
him: that is all that I implore of the kindness
of fate; and fate to-night hears my
prayer....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>How?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>The proof is grave and sad; I would have
liked to spare you.... But you know better
than I that there are salutary sufferings,
before which it is shameful to fly.... A
sign will be enough to overturn a world....
A little movement of that neck which as yet
bends without anxiety, a single glance of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
eyes, too confident and too full of innocence,
will destroy before my sight the most beautiful
thing that love has created in a woman's heart....
And yet, it must be.... It is right, it
is well that this thing should to-day be lost
in tears which it may yet be possible to
wipe away; for later it would have had to
sink in sorrows which nothing could have
consoled....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>That, at this very moment, when all that is
spotless and true, limpid and ardent in your
heart, when all the transparent virtues of your
soul, all the faithfulness, all the loyalty and all
the innocence of your virgin blood mount up
towards him whom you had selected to make
of him the purest, the happiest of men, he is
there, behind us, at two steps from this bank,
sheltered by those leaves which he thinks
impenetrable, in the arms of the woman with
whom, the other day, as you yourself saw, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
profaned the marvellous love which you have
given him!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Why do you say no, without looking?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Because he is myself....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>I do not ask you to believe my words: I
simply ask you to turn your head....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Do you hear the murmur of their voices
mingling and the song of kisses answering
kisses?...</p>

<p>Do not raise your voice to interrupt a crime
which you do not wish to see.... They will
not hear you; they listen only to the sound
of their lips!... But turn, Joyzelle, I beseech
you!... Your life is at stake and all
the happiness to which you have a right!...
Do not reject the proffered truth that comes
to save you if you have the courage at last to
accept it! It will not return except to make
you weep, when it is too late!... But look!
Look!... You need not even turn your head!...
Your star is kind to you and does not tire!...
Do not close your eyes, it is coming to unseal
them!... See!... The shadow of their
arms, lengthened by the moonlight, is creeping
along that arch and covering your knees!...
Open your eyes! Look!... It is coming to
defy you, it is rising to your lips!...</p>

alone, I cannot fight alone against all the
strength of death approaching!... If no one
comes, it will end by conquering!... Help,
I say!... You must come to my aid!...
Life must help me, or it is no longer possible
and we shall succumb!...</p>

<p>(<i>Starting up, as though to go to him, while
still holding <span class="smcap">Lancéor</span> in a close embrace.</i>)
Ah, it is you!... So it is you!... At last
here is help and life coming!... Look at
him! See!... It is time, he is falling back!...
I fling myself at your feet!... Yes, yes,
you can do all; and I have seen clear in all
things!... Ah, at such moments as this, one
would see clear in the depths of a darkness
which worlds have never traversed!... Oh,
I entreat you, tell me what to do!... I am
no longer Joyzelle, I am no longer fierce and
I have no more pride.... I am broken and
dead: I drag myself at your feet; and it is
no more a question of this or that, of love or
kisses, or of trifling things!... Life and death
stand face to face, they are fighting under our
eyes and must be separated.... You do not
move a step!... Ah, I know how great your
hatred is and how you detest that defenceless
man!... Yes, you are right, he is anything
you please, he is a coward, he is a rascal, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
is your enemy, he is a twenty-fold traitor,
since you will have it so!... Yes, I admit
it, I was wrong, I confess it, and I no longer
love him, since you wish it, and I am ready
for anything, provided he be saved!... But
that must be done and that counts and all
the rest is madness!... But come, come,
come, I tell you death is triumphing and will
carry him off!... See, his hands are turning
blue and his eyes are growing dull and it is
horrible!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Joyzelle, fear nothing; his life is in my
hands and I will save him, if you wish me
to save him....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>If I wish you to save him!... But do you
not see that, if you were to hesitate, do you not
know that, if for his sake, I had to.... No,
no, I meant to say ... my distress bewilders
me.... He has ceased to breathe, I no longer
hear his heart.... You seem to me so slow!...
Do you think that there is no danger, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
need for haste?... I will speak no more; I am
making you lose minutes which perhaps were
passing to save him.... If you will not help
him yourself&mdash;and I can understand that, for
you do not love him&mdash;tell me only what I
must do to assist him; and I shall know how
to do it.... But I can see, I am sure that he
cannot wait and that we must make haste....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>I have told you, Joyzelle, his life is in my
hands and cannot escape without my consent.
I warned you of it. The poison is doing its
work and I can see it. I alone can cure him,
snatch him from death, call back his vigour,
his beauty, which are fading away, and restore
him to you as he was before....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Ah, I entreat you, do not dally thus!...
What is his beauty to me, if his life escapes us?...
Give him back to me as he is, whatever he
may be, what care I, if only I have him back, if
only he breathes!...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I will give him back to you. I have
already twice done&mdash;and each time repented&mdash;what
I will do again for the last time, since you
ask it: but it is a sacrifice which none but you
could have obtained. By restoring his life, I
risk my own. To rouse his strength, to recall
his soul, I must give him a part of my strength,
a part of my soul. It may be that he will take
from me more than I have left and that I shall
fall dead beside the rival whom I shall have
restored to life.... Time was when I would
thus risk my existence to save a stranger by the
wayside, almost without hesitating and without
asking anything in exchange.... But to-day
I am more prudent and more wise. As I am
offering my life, it is but fair that I should be
paid for it and paid in advance; and I will
give it to him only if you promise me the
dearest moment of your own....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>How?... What am I to do?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Aside.</i>) O poor and all too innocent child!...
And you, my chaste thoughts, oh, take no
part in the odious words which my voice must
now spread around their love!... I blush at
the proof and am ashamed of what I am now
compelled to say.... You will forgive me
when you know all.... It is not I that
speak: it is the future, which man ought not
to know, the shameless, pitiless future, which
reveals a day and throws light upon a destiny
only to conceal the rest and which wishes that
I should know whether you are she whom it
marks out....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>What are you saying?... Why do you
hesitate?... There is nothing in the world;
examine myself as I may, I see nothing in the
world, in our world or in the other, that I could
be asked and not be ready to....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>See, I will cease talking in riddles....
That man whom you see and whom you hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
pressed in your arms lies stretched as near
death as though he were laid on the slab of
his tomb.... A movement can bring him
back to life; a movement can make him fall on
the other side.... Well, at the very moment
when you say yes and before the echo which
slumbers yonder under those marble vaults has
time to repeat that you have consented, I will
make the certain movement which will snatch
him from the darkness, provided that you
promise to come to-night, here, in this room
in which I shall restore him to you and on
this same bed over which you are leaning, to
give yourself to me, without shame, without
reserve....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I?... Give myself to you?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I, give myself to you, when he is restored
to me?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>So that he may be restored to you.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No, I have not understood.... There are
words, no doubt, which I do not understand....
No, it is not possible that a man who is not
one of the princes of hell should come thus, at
the moment when all love's sorrow knows not
what to hope for nor what to undertake....
No, I have mistaken you and I am doing you
an injury.... You must forgive me, I am a
virgin, I am ignorant, I do not quite know what
those words imply.... But I see now....
Yes, you are right.... Yes, yes, you mean to
say that it is fair that I should bear a share of
the danger and that my life should be joined for
a moment to yours, in order to create the other
life which is to revive him.... But I want
that share, I want it for myself alone, I want
the whole of it, the greatest possible share,
and I never hoped that it could be given
me....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Joyzelle, time presses.... Do not seek elsewhere:
you know what I am asking and the
word means all that you dare not believe....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Then, at the very moment when he comes
back to me, when I see him once more breathing
in my arms and smiling at the love which he
will have found again, I shall have to snatch
from him all that I have given?... But what
remains for him if you take everything from
us; and what shall I tell him when he kisses
me?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>You will tell him nothing, if you wish for his
happiness....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>But I must tell him everything, since I love
him!... No, no, I can see clearly, that cannot
be, that does not exist; and there must be gods
or demons to prevent such things: if not, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
cannot see why one should wish to live.... I
have confidence in them, I have confidence in
you.... It was only a proof; and all this is
not, cannot be real.... It seems to me that
already you look at me with less ill-will....
See, I beseech you, I throw myself at your feet
and kiss your hands.... I will confess all to
you.... I did not love you, you hated him too
much; but I never believed that you were unjust
or unworthy of love.... When you came in,
I did not hesitate, I went up to you, I asked
you to snatch from death the only man I
love; and yet I knew that you love me too....
But, I do not know why, my instinct told me
that you were generous and capable of doing
what I would have done for you, what he himself
would have done; and, when you have done
what we would have done, you shall have in our
hearts a part of our love that is not the least
good part, nor the least fine, nor the most perishable....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I know: when I have given him back
his life, at the risk of my own, he will have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
kisses, the lips and the eyes, the days and the
nights, all, in short, that forms love's vain and
ephemeral happiness!... But I, I shall have
something much better; and sometimes, by
chance, in passing, I shall be vouchsafed a
kindly smile, which will not perish, provided
that I refrain from demanding it too often....
No, Joyzelle, at my age we are no longer satisfied
with illusions of that kind nor with those
deceptive dregs. The hour of heroic falsehoods
is past for me. I wish to have what he will have.
I care little for your smile, which I know to be
impossible: I want yourself; I want you absolutely,
were it only for a moment; but I shall
have that moment: he will give it me....
(<i>Approaching <span class="smcap">Lancéor</span>.</i>) Look at him, Joyzelle:
his features are becoming distorted;
we have waited too long and the danger
increases with each minute that passes....
Will you come?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Casting a bewildered glance around her.</i>)
Nothing bursts, nothing falls and I am alone
in the world!...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Feeling <span class="smcap">Lancéor's</span> body.</i>) The danger is
becoming grave.... I know the symptoms....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Well, then, yes, I will come!... I will come
to-night! I will come this evening!... But
save him first and restore him to life!... See,
his eyes are hollowing and his lips are fading
and I stand here bargaining for his life, as
though it were a question of....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>He shall be restored to you; but remember,
Joyzelle, if you are not true to your promise,
the hand that cures him will strike him mercilessly....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>But I shall be true to it and I would go on
my knees to the end of the other world to
remain true to it!... Ah, I will come, I tell
you! I give myself absolutely and I am wholly
yours!... What more do you want?... I
have nothing left!...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>It is well; I have your promise; I will fulfil
mine.... (<i>Aside, taking <span class="smcap">Lancéor</span> in his arms.</i>)
Forgive me, my son, in the name of your
destiny, which demands this torture.... (<i>He
leans over <span class="smcap">Lancéor</span> and presses a long kiss on
his eyelids and lips. Aloud.</i>) See, he returns
from the regions without light.... Life is
restored to him, but he will awake only in
your eager arms. I leave you to your work.
Remember your word....</p>

<p>Lancéor!... His eyes have opened and

before me and the roses of dawn and the flowers

are skies that open! There are gods of love!
There are gods of life!... We must thank

<p>Yes, it is you, it is indeed you, it is you and
the light.... And then this room, too, which
I saw before.... Wait a little.... What
happened to me?... I remember, I remember....
I was lying yonder, yonder, I know
not where, before great doors which some one
was trying to open.... I was buried and was
turning cold.... And then I called to you,
I called without ceasing and you did not
come....</p>

<p>No, you were not there.... I was seized
with icy coldness, I was seized with darkness
and I was losing my life.... But now it is
you!... Yes, yes, my eyes see you, they
behold you suddenly as they emerge from the
dark.... Scared though they be by the glaring
light, it is you they see and I am passing
from the tomb to the joy of the sunlight in the
arms of love! That seems impossible to one
coming from so far!... I must touch you, I
must cling to the caresses of your hands, to the
light of your eyes, I must seize the real gold of
the hair that bears witness to the daylight!...
Oh, you could never believe how one loves
when dying, nor how I mean to love you after
losing you and finding you again!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I too, I too!...</p>

<p>And the joy of returning to the arms which
press one and which still tremble, because they
had ceased to hope!... Do you feel yours
quiver and mine adore you?... They seek,
they enlace one another, they fear lest they
should lose one another, they no longer dare to
open.... They no longer obey, they do not
know that they are hurting us and are like to
stifle us in their blind intoxication!... Ah,
they know at last the worth of clasping a
glowing body; and one would die to learn life
and to know love!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Yes, one would die....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>The lord of the island.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>He?... But he hated me....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>It was he.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>I do not quite understand.... Did he then
bring me back to love, to life?... Was he
willing to restore me to her who loved me
and whom he loved himself?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>But why did he do it?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I besought him until he consented.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Did he hesitate?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>He said that, in saving your life, he risked
his own.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Nothing compelled him to it.... And
then, quite simply, he gave back life to the
only man who is taking away all hope of the
love that would make the happiness of his
life?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>And without asking anything, from kindness,
from pity, from generosity?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Ah, we were unjust and our worst enemies are
better than we believe!... There are treasures
of nobility and love even in the heart of hatred!...
And this thing which he has done!...
No, I really do not know that I could have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
as much; and I would never have thought that
that poor old man.... But is it not almost incredible,
Joyzelle, and is it not heroic?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Where is he? We must go and fling ourselves
at his feet, confess our error, wipe out the
injustice of which we were guilty when we did
not love him.... He must have his part and
the best part of the happiness which he restores
to us!... He must have our hearts, our joy,
our smiles and our tears of love, all that one
can give to those who give all!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>We will go, we will go....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Joyzelle, what is it?... You scarcely
answer me.... I do not know if my senses
are still in the power of the night whence I
am issuing, but I do not recognize your words
and your movements.... You seem to be
seeking, doubting, dreaming.... And I, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
return to you full of love and joy, find so little
of either in your eyes, which avoid me, in your
hands, which forget me.... What has happened?
Why recall me and restore me to
life, if, during my absence, I have lost what
I love?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Oh no, no, Lancéor, you have not lost me!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Your voice seeks a smile and finds but a
sob....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I wanted to smile and I am smiling now....
But do not be surprised: I have wept so
long and so desperately that the tears still
rise in spite of myself.... Joy was so far
away that it could not return with the first
kisses.... It will need many before it recovers
confidence in my heart; and I am almost sad in
the midst of my happiness....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my poor Joyzelle!... Is that what your
grave silence means?... And I was distressing
myself like a stupid child!... I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
thinking only of myself, I am drunk with life
and understand nothing.... I was forgetting
that in your place I should have lost courage....
It is true, you are right, it is you, not I,
returning from death; and, when two beings
love as we do, the one that does not die
is the only one that really dies.... Do not
hide your tears.... The sadder you appear,
the more I feel that you love me.... Now it
is for me to take care of you, now it is for me to
call back your soul, to warm your disconcerted
hands, to pursue your lips and bring you back
to the midst of the happiness which we had
lost.... We shall soon be there, since love is
our guide.... It triumphs over everything
when it finds two hearts that give themselves to
it fearlessly and without reserve.... All the
rest is nothing, all the rest is forgotten, all
the rest withdraws to make way for love....</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Father!... Then it is true, and you are

since you told me, as though I had always
known it in my far-seeing heart.... (<i>Coming
closer.</i>) But how wonderful it is!... I see
you again at last as I saw you amid my
childish sports; and, when I look at you, I
see myself in a graver, nobler and more
powerful mirror than those which reflect my
features along this room. But what will
Joyzelle say?... How she will laugh when
she remembers her fears, for she imagined....
No, she herself shall tell you what she
thought, to punish her for her senseless terror....
She used to hate you, but with a softened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>

you suffer, I have but been the instrument
of fate and the unworthy slave of another
will, whose source I do not know, which
seems to demand that the slightest happiness
should be surrounded by tears.... I
have but hastened, in order to bring happiness
more quickly, the coming of those tears
which hung in suspense between your two
destinies.... You shall know some day by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
what power, a power which has no magical
or supernatural quality, but which still lies
hidden at the bottom of men's lives, I at
times command certain phenomena, certain
appearances that bewildered you. You shall
also learn that I have acquired the gift, often
a useless one, of reading the future a little
more clearly and a little further than the
rest of men.... And so I saw you, groping
for each other, in time and space, for an unparalleled
love, the most perfect perhaps that
the two or three centuries over which my
eyes have turned concealed within their shade....
You might have met each other after
many wanderings; but it was necessary to
hasten the expected meeting, because of you,
my son, whom death claimed in the absence
of love.... And, on the other side, nothing
marked out Joyzelle for the hoped-for love,
save a few scattered and uncertain points and
the proofs themselves which she was to surmount.
I therefore hurried on the prescribed
proofs: they have all been painful, but necessary;
the last will be decisive and more
serious....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>Serious?... What do you mean?...
It will not be dangerous for Joyzelle, or for
others?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>It will not be dangerous for Joyzelle, but
it imperils, for the last time, the predestined
love to which your life is linked.... That
is why, in despite of all, in despite of my confidence,
of my anticipations, of my certainty
even, I am afraid, I tremble a little at the
approach of the decisive hour....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>If Joyzelle is to decide, love has nothing
to fear.... Come, do not hesitate, Joyzelle
will always be the source of joy.... But I
do not understand how, knowing the future,
you are not able to see her triumph beforehand?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>I already told you, before we came in here,
that Joyzelle can change the future which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
she faces.... She possesses a force which
I have seen in none save her; that is why I
do not know whether the great victory which
your love expects will not be mingled with
some little shadow and tears....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?... You seem perturbed....
What are you hiding from me?...
How can you believe that Joyzelle would
ever be the cause of a tear or the cause of a
shadow?... There is nothing in Joyzelle,
not even the suffering which she might inflict,
there is nothing in her but brings health,
happiness and love!... Ah, how well I see
that you know little of the living triumph,
the endless dawn contained in her voice,
her eyes, her heart!... One must have
held her in his arms to know what treasures
of hope, what torrents of certainty issue from
the least word murmured by her lips, from
the slightest smile that plays upon her face....
But I am too long delaying the impatient
victory. Go, father, go.... I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
remain here, I will wait, I will watch the happy
moments pass, until my Joyzelle utters a
great cry of joy which shall tell me that
love has determined destiny....</p>

<p>Arielle, the hour is striking and Joyzelle is

of my useless life; and yet I would that my
death, if possible, should not come to sadden
the most ardent and innocent love that the
world has known.... But you tremble, you

tears.... What do you see, my child, that
you contemplate with so great a dread?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>Master, I beseech you, abandon this proof:
there is yet time!... My eyes cannot see
through the mist that surrounds it.... It
may be mortal, I see it, I feel it; and chance
has placed our two lives in the hand of a

I have always served you as your very thought....

no longer.... You well know that my death

can still escape the danger....</p>

<p>I cannot abandon the last proof.... It is

It is for you to grasp the as yet uncertain
weapon which Joyzelle is preparing to raise
against us....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Arielle.</span></p>

<p>But I do not know that I shall succeed!...
Joyzelle's strength is so swift, so profound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
that it escapes my arm, escapes my eyes, escapes
destiny!... I see only the flash of falling
steel.... All is confused in a shadow; and
my life and yours depend on a movement of
my unskilful hand....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>She is there, I hear her, she is feeling for

my fate....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Stopping, haggard, hesitating, trembling.</i>)
Now and here.... I have taken the last step....
Until this moment, which time can no
longer keep back and which is about to see a
thing that will never be wiped out; until I
came to that little door which has just closed
upon two captive destinies, I knew, I knew all
that I had to do.... Ah, I had reflected
and I had judged so well!... There was
nothing but that, there was nothing else: it
was certain, it was just, it was inevitable!...
But now all changes and I have forgotten all....
There are other powers, there are other
voices and I am all alone against all that speaks
in the uncertain night.... Justice, where are
you?... Justice, what must I do?... I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
act because you wished it.... You convinced
me and urged me on.... There, but now,
under the thousands of stars which shone upon
the door and which you invoked to reassure my
soul!... There was no doubt, then, and all
the certainty of all that breathes and of all
that quivers and of all that loves and has a
right to love illumined my heart!... But, in
face of the deed, you yourself draw back, you
deny your laws and abandon me!... Ah, I
feel too much alone, delivered like a blind
slave to the unknown.... I shall walk without
looking.... I see nothing and I shall
not raise my mad eyes to the bed until the
moment when the thing.... (<i>She advances
with a mechanical step to the foot of the
bed.</i>) Now, fate itself shall say yes.... (<i>She
lifts the lamp, looks at the bed, sees <span class="smcap">Merlin</span>
sleeping and, in her surprise, takes a step back.</i>)
He sleeps!... What is this?... I had not
foreseen.... Anything but this.... Must I
wait still?... Oh, I should like to wait!...
He is sound asleep.... Then he did not wish....
But, if he were not asleep, I could not have
done it.... He would have disarmed me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
he would have mastered me.... It must
be true, it is fate, it is a good and just fate
that delivers him to me thus.... I, who
was looking for a sign!... But there is the
sign!... What more do I want, if I want
anything more?... And yet, as he is asleep,
I cannot know.... Perhaps he has pity, perhaps
he renounces and would bid me go!...
He was not without soul; and often, at moments,
he spoke like a father.... Ah, if he had risen,
if he had been there, with arms held out to me,
in an attitude of.... Then, then I should have
been strong and should have conquered!...
But a man asleep.... That shatters hatred....
And then, one no longer knows.... And
to change this sleep which one word puts to
flight into that which no human or superhuman
power can disturb!... Oh, I would at least
that one word of forgiveness.... Ah no, I am
too great a coward!... This is terror seeking
an outlet.... I did not come for further meditation....
There is no doubt, after what he
did, after what he said!... I listen only to
my voice, the voice of my destiny, which wills
that I should save us both!... So much the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
worse if I am wrong!... I am right! I am
right!... Go out, my lamp: I have seen all
that I need see.... (<i>She puts out the lamp,
places it on one of the marble stairs, seizes the
dagger which she held concealed, raises it and
looks at it for a moment.</i>) Now, it is your
turn!... Ah, if you could do what my
thought, what my desperate pity would have,
and if the death that gleams at the point of
this blade were not real death, irrevocable
death!... But enough.... It is time....
It is said, it is done, I strike!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Still failing to understand, and struggling.</i>)
No, no, no!... I could not.... Ah, though
my heart fail me, I have courage yet!...
And I have all my life, if I no longer have
my strength, and never, no, never, so long as I
have breath....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Look at me, Joyzelle.... I am restoring its
strength to the arm which you raised in love's
defence.... I leave it its weapon which tried
to strike me and which was striking true....
Until that movement, all was undecided; now,
all is clear, all is radiant and sure.... Look at
me, Joyzelle, and no longer fear my lips....
They seek your brow, there at last to place the
kiss which the father lays on the brow of his
daughter....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>What is this and what do you mean that
I cannot understand?... Yes, I see in your
eyes that you seem to love me as one loves a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
child.... So I was mistaken and I was on the
point of...?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>No, you were right; you would not have
been she whom love demands if you had not
done what you were going to do.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>I do not know, I am dreaming.... But
since it is not the abominable thing, I abandon
myself to my dream....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Yes, it is true, my Joyzelle, I am yearning
to enjoy your delighted surprise, to follow your
glances which seem to me so beautiful in their
astonished flight, in which confidence dawns
and which no longer know where to rest their
wings, like sea-birds that have lost the shore....
I am taking my share of the happiness
which I bestow.... I shall have no other....
But do not be anxious, we shall together enter
into fate's secrets; and, when Lancéor....</p>

<p>Where is he?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Ah, that name rouses you; and see, the shore
appears to those glances lost in space!...
Listen, I hear him.... Your heart, without
our knowing it, has gone to tell him that you
loved him to the point which love cannot surpass....
He is hastening, he is here!...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Father!... She is mine!...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>My son, she has triumphed; destiny gives
her to you....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Taking <span class="smcap">Joyzelle</span> in his arms and covering
her with wild kisses.</i>) Ah, I knew it and I
was sure of it!... Joyzelle, my Joyzelle!...
I do not ask what you can have done to disarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
fate.... I know nothing yet; but we know all
beforehand who love each other as you and I
love; and already I hail the new truth that
must have been revealed at the first touch of
your heart!... Ah, father, father, I told you,
I told you!... But she does not understand
why I am embracing you.... It is true, I go
too fast.... Come here, Joyzelle, that I may
unite you both in my arms.... We had with
us an enemy who loves us; he was obliged to
make us suffer; and that gentle enemy was my
own father, whom I thought lost, my father
here, my father found again, who awaits but
a smile to embrace you too.... Oh, do not
turn away, do not look at me with those eyes
already laden with reproaches.... I have
hidden nothing from you.... I knew it to-day,
this evening, the moment you left me;
and, so soon as I knew it, I had to fly far from
you, lest I should betray myself, for all our
happiness, it appears, depended on this last
secret; and, when a secret is committed to
love, it is as though one hid a lighted lamp in
a crystal vase.... You would have learnt all
merely by seeing my eyes, my hands, my very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
shadow; and I could not show you my happiness....
You were not to know of it till the
great proof.... It was necessary that you
should do an impossible thing.... What
thing I do not know; but, smile as I might,
I had to yield; I had to wait and patiently
count the minutes of the hour which thus
separated our two impatient passions.... But
now, I hasten, I listen, I want to know....
Speak, speak, I am listening....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Since you are happy, I am happy, too....
I know nothing more.... I have scarce
awakened from a horrible and incomprehensible
dream....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Yes, my poor Joyzelle, the dream was horrible;
but now it is overcome and the proof is
past, establishing a happiness which nothing
threatens now, except the enemy that threatens
all men....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>But what, when all is told, was that fearful
proof?...</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Joyzelle will tell you in the first kisses, free
from all anxiety, which you will exchange after
this victory. They will veil better than my
poor words what, in this proof, appears unpardonable....
The proof was dangerous and
almost insurmountable.... Joyzelle could
have chosen a different course.... She might
have yielded, sacrificed herself, sacrificed her
love, despaired, I know not what!... She
would not have been the Joyzelle that was
expected.... There was but one path traced
by destiny; she entered upon it, followed it to
the end and saved your life in saving her own
love....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>It is ordained, then, that love strikes and
kills all that tries to bar its way?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>No, Joyzelle, I do not know.... Let us not
make laws with a few scraps picked up in the
darkness that surrounds our thoughts.... But
she who was to do what you were willing to do
was she whom fate intended for my son.... It
was therefore written, for you and for you alone
and perhaps for those who resemble you a little,
that they have a right to the love which fate
points out to them; and that that love must
break down injustice.... I do not judge you:
it is fate that approves you; but I am over-joyed
that it has thus chosen you among all
women....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Father!... I tremble still when I see that
weapon which, for a moment.... Forgive me,
father, I loved you already....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>It is I who ask you now to offer me a forgiving
hand....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No, no, these are not the cold hands of forgiveness!...
These are the hands that caress,
worship and give thanks!... I know now why,
despite my hatred, I could not hate!... What
you have done was more difficult than all that I
have done, because it was cruel; and, when I
think again on what has happened, it is you, it
is you, father, who have endured the heaviest
and the most deserving proof....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>No, the most deserving was not among those
which you can discover.... It will remain the
secret of this heart which loves you both and
unites you within itself and which, to change
this too-deep secret into happiness, asks my two
children for but a moment of their joy and perhaps
for a kiss a little longer than those granted
in passing to old men whose time on earth is
short....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Throwing himself in <span class="smcap">Merlin's</span> arms.</i>)

<p>(<i>Smiling.</i>) I see you, Arielle: you love all
three of us; but a more ardent kiss ascends
towards Joyzelle than those which you give to
us.... There, kiss her; the proof is finished
in my old heart too.... Yet a little while and
we shall be far from her and far from all love....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>What are you saying, father, and to whom are
you speaking?... It seems as though flowers
which I cannot gather were lightly touching my
forehead and caressing my lips....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Do not repel them, they are sad and pure....
It is my poor Arielle who spreads them over
you; it is my invisible daughter, the good fairy
of the island, who discovered and protected you
and Lancéor. She wishes to mingle, for the
last time, in your great love and asks for a
share, as discreet as herself, of the happiness
which we owe her....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Where is she?... I see no one near but you
and Lancéor....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>And do you think, my child, that we see all
that lives deep down in our lives?... Be kind
and gentle to poor Arielle.... She is now
giving you a parting kiss before going far
away to disappear with me in the regions
where fate wills that my destiny should be
fulfilled....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lancéor.</span></p>

<p>To disappear with you?... Father, I do
not know....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Let us not question those who have nothing
more to say.... All is now determined....
Thanks to the unknown gods, I have been able
to give happiness to the two hearts that were
dearest to me; but I can do no more, nor can
you do anything, for my own happiness....
I am going towards my destiny and I go in
silence, lest I should sadden this smiling hour,
which is yours alone.... I know what awaits
me; and nevertheless I am going....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>No, no, no, no, father, you shall not go!...
We are around you, and if some danger which
we cannot see threatens your old age, we shall
try at least to alleviate the dread of it....
When there are three to undergo a misfortune
and those three love one another, then the
misfortune changes to a burden of love, which
we bear with delight....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>Alas, no, my Joyzelle: it would all be useless!...
Would to the gods that men had to pass
only through kindly evils, as yours were!...
But all life's secret purposes are not so clear,
are not so good.... But we speak in vain of
what is written.... I am still here, in the
arms of those who love me.... The day of my
distress is not this day.... Let us enjoy our
hour, in the sweet sadness that follows on great
joys, by listening to our minutes of love, passing
and fleeting, one by one, in that frail ray of
nocturnal light in which we clasp one another
for our greater happiness.... The rest does
not as yet belong to men....</p>

<p>(<i>Who has remained standing at the foot

Master!</p>

<p>I see you, Arielle, and I will obey....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>What are you saying, father, and to whom
are you speaking?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Merlin.</span></p>

<p>To her who opened up to you the road to
happiness. She is now giving you a parting
kiss, which I also give you....</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>Father!</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Joyzelle.</span></p>

<p>What does this mean and what has
happened?</p>

more to say. Would to the gods that, &amp;c.</p>
